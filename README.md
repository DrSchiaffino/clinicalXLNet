# clinical XLNet

We pretrain the [XLNet-Base model](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet) on the [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/) discharge summary dataset for 200K steps on top of the XLNet-Base checkpoint and achieved loss xxx. 

Tensorflow checkpoint and Pytorch checkpoint are available:

[TF Model]()

[Torch Model]()

Downstream evaluations on specific clinical task will be out in a few months.
